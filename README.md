# Image Process StreamLit ML App

## Project Overview

The **Image Process StreamLit ML App** is an innovative web application designed to leverage machine learning for real-time image and video processing. Built using Streamlit, this app provides users with an intuitive interface to analyze images and videos with advanced computer vision techniques.

## Key Features

- **Real-Time Detection**: The app utilizes machine learning models to detect faces and hands in real time using webcam input.
- **Interactive User Interface**: Built with Streamlit, the application offers a seamless and interactive experience for users to upload images or use their webcam for immediate processing.
- **Landmark Visualization**: Detected faces and hands are highlighted with landmarks, providing visual feedback on the detection process.
- **Custom Model Integration**: The app is capable of integrating various machine learning models, enabling users to experiment with different algorithms and techniques for image analysis.

## Technologies Used

- **Streamlit**: A powerful library for creating web applications in Python.
- **OpenCV**: An open-source computer vision and machine learning software library for image processing.
- **MediaPipe**: A framework for building multimodal applied machine learning pipelines, particularly in computer vision tasks.
- **Python**: The primary programming language used to develop the application.

## Application Flow

1. **User Interaction**: Users can either upload an image or access the webcam for live processing.
2. **Image Processing**: The application processes the input image or video stream using the integrated machine learning models.
3. **Display Results**: Detected objects (faces and hands) are highlighted on the interface with landmarks, providing immediate visual feedback to users.
4. **Output Options**: Users can save or download the processed images or share their results.

## Use Cases

- **Educational Purposes**: Ideal for learning about computer vision and machine learning concepts.
- **Research and Development**: Researchers can utilize the app to test and validate their models in a user-friendly environment.
- **Prototyping**: Quickly prototype computer vision applications without extensive setup or infrastructure.

## Future Enhancements

- **Model Training**: Allow users to train their own models directly within the app for personalized results.
- **Extended Object Detection**: Incorporate additional object detection models to enhance the app's capabilities.
- **Mobile Compatibility**: Develop a mobile-friendly version of the application for broader accessibility.
